	I am a hobbyist photographer who wanted my own space to display some of my photography. Here I have created a small gallery directive to showcase my understanding of AngularJS concepts. I used the Flickr API and an AngularJS service to fetch the images. NgClass and ngClick are used to change the styling on the images when they are selected.
